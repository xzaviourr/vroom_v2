Experiments : 
1. Single workload
- Keep memory constant, vary GPU cores, Arrival rate, Measure Throughput, Latency Distribution, Average Latency, Total Time GPU was working
- Keep GPU cores constant, vary GPU Memory, Arrival rate, Measure Throughput, Latency Distribution, Average Latency, Total Time GPU was working

2. Colocated workload
- Keep memory, GPU cores constant, vary Arrival rate, Num-colocation, Measure Throughput, Latency Distribution, Average Latency, Total Time GPU was working (NO OVERPROVISIONING)

- Keep memory, GPU cores constant, vary Arrival rate, Num-colocation, Measure Throughput, Latency Distribution, Average Latency, Total Time GPU was working (WITH OVERPROVISIONING)
