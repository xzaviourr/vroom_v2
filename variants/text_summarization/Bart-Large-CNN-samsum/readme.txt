List of items in dockerfile that can be changed-
    * Base image should be nvidia/cuda:12.1.0-runtime-ubuntu20.04, on 18.04 there were many version errors due to python3.6 and pip9
    * timm package needs to be installed(pipreqs cannot capture this package from app.py)
    * pipreqs --mode no-pin does not list the versions along with the package
                    (but on ubuntu20.04 should work on default mode - NOT TESTED)
